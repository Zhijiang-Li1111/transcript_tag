# Tasks: Export Bundle Activation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-enable-export-zip/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Follow quickstart guidanceâ€”add unit, integration, and accessibility coverage when interactions change.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 0: Constitution Alignment (Shared)

**Purpose**: Validate gates before implementation.

- [X] T001 Confirm constitution gates remain satisfied after research/data model additions in `specs/001-enable-export-zip/plan.md`
- [X] T002 [P] Capture reused UI components and accessibility commitments for export control in `specs/001-enable-export-zip/contracts/export-control.md`

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Prepare fixtures and documentation required across the feature.

- [X] T010 Create fully annotated session fixture for export scenarios in `tests/integration/fixtures/exportReadySession.ts`
- [X] T011 [P] Add representative VTT fixture covering varied cue importance levels in `tests/integration/fixtures/export-ready-sample.vtt`
- [X] T012 [P] Extend manual QA pre-checks with export readiness prerequisites in `specs/001-enable-export-zip/quickstart.md`

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story work.

- [X] T020 Implement `isSessionComplete` and remaining cue selectors in `src/hooks/useAnnotationSession.ts`
- [X] T021 [P] Define `ExportControlViewModel` and readiness helpers in `src/types/annotation.ts`
- [X] T022 [P] Update export packaging to support empty metadata and deterministic filenames in `src/utils/annotationExport.ts`
- [X] T023 [P] Enhance shared button to expose `aria-disabled` and focus styles in `src/components/ui/Button.tsx`

**Checkpoint**: Foundation readyâ€”User Story 1 can now begin.

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Export Completed Session (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

**Goal**: Allow annotators to download a JSON+VTT archive once every cue is rated, with accessible state transitions.

**Independent Test**: Upload sample VTT, rate all cues, observe Export control enabling, trigger download, and verify archive contents.

### Tests for User Story 1

> Write tests before implementation; ensure they fail initially.

- [X] T030 [P] [US1] Cover `isSessionComplete` and remaining cue helpers in `tests/utils/useAnnotationSession.test.ts`
- [X] T031 [P] [US1] Simulate end-to-end export activation flow in `tests/integration/exportBundleActivation.test.tsx`
- [X] T032 [P] [US1] Validate export control keyboard/announcement behaviour in `tests/accessibility/exportControl.a11y.test.ts`

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T033 [P] [US1] Create export control component with pending/tooltip states in `src/components/transcript/ExportControls.tsx`
- [X] T034 [US1] Integrate export control into session view and thread readiness state in `src/components/transcript/CueImportanceTagger.tsx`
- [X] T035 [P] [US1] Surface remaining cue guidance alongside controls in `src/components/transcript/CueList.tsx`
- [X] T036 [US1] Trigger export, manage download/toasts, and call `markExported` in `src/components/transcript/ExportControls.tsx`
- [X] T037 [US1] Update manual verification steps post-implementation in `specs/001-enable-export-zip/quickstart.md`

**Checkpoint**: User Story 1 is fully functional and independently testable.

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Stabilise performance and documentation.

- [ ] T040 [P] Record export performance sampling for large transcripts in `specs/001-enable-export-zip/research.md`
- [ ] T041 Log final manual smoke test results following quickstart flow in `specs/001-enable-export-zip/quickstart.md`
- [ ] T042 [P] Review session persistence for redundant flags post-export in `src/hooks/useAnnotationSession.ts`

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 0** â†’ Must finish before touching infrastructure or UI tasks.
- **Phase 1** â†’ Builds fixtures/docs used across feature; required before foundation to avoid rework.
- **Phase 2** â†’ Blocks all user story workâ€”complete selectors, utilities, and shared UI adjustments first.
- **Phase 3 (US1)** â†’ Starts only after Phase 2; delivers MVP.
- **Polish** â†’ Runs after US1 is validated.

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (P1)** depends on foundational selectors/utilities being ready. No other user stories exist in this increment, enabling direct MVP delivery.

### Within User Story 1

1. Execute tests (T030â€“T032) so they fail.
2. Implement UI components and hook wiring (T033â€“T036).
3. Update documentation (T037) once functionality passes checks.

### Parallel Opportunities

- Fixture/documentation tasks T010â€“T012 can run concurrently.
- Foundational enhancements T021â€“T023 touch separate files and can execute in parallel after T020.
- User Story tests T030â€“T032 are parallel-safe once fixtures exist.
- Implementation tasks T033 and T035 can progress in parallel; T036 follows once export component scaffolding exists.
- Polish tasks T040 and T042 are parallelizable after US1 completion.

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Parallel test development (after fixtures ready)
Task: "- [ ] T030 [P] [US1] Cover isSessionComplete and remaining cue helpers in tests/utils/useAnnotationSession.test.ts"
Task: "- [ ] T031 [P] [US1] Simulate end-to-end export activation flow in tests/integration/exportBundleActivation.test.tsx"
Task: "- [ ] T032 [P] [US1] Validate export control keyboard/announcement behaviour in tests/accessibility/exportControl.a11y.test.ts"

# Parallel UI implementation once foundation is complete
Task: "- [ ] T033 [P] [US1] Create export control component with pending/tooltip states in src/components/transcript/ExportControls.tsx"
Task: "- [ ] T035 [P] [US1] Surface remaining cue guidance alongside controls in src/components/transcript/CueList.tsx"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phases 0â€“2 to satisfy constitution gates and shared infrastructure.
2. Deliver Phase 3 (US1) end-to-end, ensuring tests pass and manual verification succeeds.
3. Stop and validate export bundle functionality before moving to polish.

### Incremental Delivery

1. Ship foundational selectors/utilities alongside fixtures (Phases 1â€“2).
2. Implement export control UI and automation tests (Phase 3) for MVP release.
3. Execute polish tasks to capture performance metrics and cleanup prior to handoff.

### Parallel Team Strategy

- Developer A: Phase 2 hook + utility work (T020â€“T022).
- Developer B: Shared UI updates and future ExportControls component (T023, T033, T036).
- Developer C: Testing + documentation (T030â€“T032, T037, T041).
- All: Converge on polish tasks (T040â€“T042) after MVP validation.

## Notes

- [P] tasks denote safe parallelization (distinct files, no blocking dependencies).
- All tasks reference concrete file paths for clarity.
- Ensure tests fail before implementation to confirm coverage.
- Maintain accessibility and performance guardrails captured in the specification.
