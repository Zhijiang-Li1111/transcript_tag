# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft (update to In Review/Approved when applicable)  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

Each user story must deliver an independently shippable slice that reuses the existing layout, keeps the experience consistent, and records accessibility expectations. Prioritise journeys by user value (P1 is highest) and describe how the story can be demonstrated alone.

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language, referencing the shared components it touches.]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently—include the manual or automated path that proves the story works end-to-end]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [keyboard interaction], **Then** [expected accessible outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [screen reader announcement], **Then** [expected output]

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [error condition], **Then** [accessible error messaging]

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the uploaded transcript is empty or exceeds [limit] cues?
- How does the system handle connectivity loss while annotations are pending?
- What occurs if local session storage is unavailable or cleared?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Application MUST allow annotators to [primary action, e.g., "assign importance to cues"] using existing UI patterns.
- **FR-002**: UI MUST maintain layout consistency with `MainLayout` and shared transcript components.
- **FR-003**: Interaction flows MUST remain keyboard-navigable with visible focus states.
- **FR-004**: System MUST persist session data through the defined `localStorage` key strategy or document an alternative.
- **FR-005**: Exported annotation payloads MUST adhere to the schema defined in `src/types/annotation.ts`.

*Mark unclear items explicitly, e.g. `NEEDS CLARIFICATION` when requirements are incomplete.*

### Data Contracts *(include when data is involved)*

- **[Entity]**: [Describe TypeScript interface/location, required fields, optional fields]
- **[Payload]**: [Describe versioning strategy and migration implications]

## UX & Accessibility Guardrails

- Visual rhythm: [Document spacing, typography, and colour token usage]
- Interaction alignment: [List existing components/hooks reused and any new patterns that require review]
- Accessibility validation: [Keyboard flow, ARIA roles, screen reader copy, contrast checks]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Quantify primary success, e.g., "Annotators complete cue tagging without refresh in <5 minutes"]
- **SC-002**: [Performance target, e.g., "Cue navigation renders in <100 ms median"]
- **SC-003**: [Accessibility target, e.g., "All interactive elements pass axe-core smoke tests"]
- **SC-004**: [Business metric, e.g., "At least 80% of sessions export successfully on first attempt"]
